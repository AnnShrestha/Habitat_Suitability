**Project Goals**:
The primary goal is to model and map the habitat preferences of three African elephants within Tarangire National Park and regions around it, Tanzania, using GPS collar 
data combined with environmental and spatial variables. The Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS) will use insights to manage elephant populations, particularly concerning 
overlapping lion habitats, to improve conservation efforts.
